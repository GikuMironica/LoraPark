The temperature, humidity, air pressure, amount of rain, condensation point, wind speed and direction, solar radiation and the number of particles of various sizes in the air (fine dust) are measured. The weather station is operated independently using a solar module. The measured results are periodically sent via the local LoRaWAN network to our backend, which processes the data for display. This sensor is part of the LoRaPark at Weinhof. Data and visualization are presented on the local display or at lorapark.de. The sensor data are also made freely available to the public on the Ulm data platform under a CC-0 license.",

If the humidity level is too low, watering is triggered. To monitor the flowerpot, especially the water level in the tank and the soil moisture, sensor data are regularly sent via LoRaWAN, which, for example, can facilitate joint urban gardening projects.",
